# Form Validation on Submit - One Error

The following example demonstrates best practices for validating form inputs on submit.

- The error should be visually and programmatically associated with the input that needs attention
  - In the code below, this programmatic association is achieved by using `aria-describedby` to
    refer to the ID of the error message when it is displayed.
  - Remember to remove this ID from `aria-describedby` when the error message is removed!
- The input that needs user attention should receive focus upon validation
  - In the code below, this is achieved by using `useRef` to create a reference to the input element
    (`inputRef`) and then shifting focus to `inputRef`
