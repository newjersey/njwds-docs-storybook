# Error Validation

Use error validation to help users identify, navigate, and recover from errors.

## Best Practices

- Always validate forms after a user action, such as Continue, Save, or Submit.
- The error should be visually and programmatically associated with the input that needs attention
  - Use `aria-describedby` to refer to the `id` of the element containing the error message when it
    is displayed.
  - Remember to remove this `id` from `aria-describedby` when the error message is removed!
- The input that needs user attention should receive focus upon validation
  - In the examples below, this is achieved by using `useRef` to create a reference to the input
    element (`inputRef` in the first example) and then shifting focus to it via `.focus()` on
    validation failure.
- Toggle error state classes (`usa-input--error`, `usa-form-group--error`, `usa-label--error`)

## Validate on Submit - Single Error Implementation

- When there are 1-2 errors, individual fields should show validation behavior. Focus should be sent
  to the first field with an error.

  of={ErrorValidation.SingleErrorValidation}
  source={{ code: ValidationOnSubmitSingleErrorSrc, language: "tsx" }}
  sourceState="hide"
/>

## Error validation for 3+ form errors with error summary

- An error summary should follow a main heading on the page, either the H1, or the most relevant
  heading to the form
- The error summary element should receive focus when triggered
- Individual errors displayed within the error summary should be links that move focus to the field
  with the error
- When 3+ errors have been triggered on submit, use an error summary to display a list of errors in
  addition to the individual field validations
- Set `tabIndex={-1}` on the error summary container to make it focusable
- Automatically focus on the error summary when it appears
- Implement error summary links as `<a>` elements that that can be clicked to focus on the
  corresponding input
- Use `role="alert"` and `aria-labelledby` pointing to the error summary heading

<Canvas
  of={ErrorValidation.MultipleErrorValidation}
  source={{ code: ValidationOnSubmitMultipleErrorsSrc, language: "tsx" }}
  sourceState="hide"
/>

## Validate on blur

- For form fields with complex requirements, validation can be implemented when the field loses
  focus ([on blur](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/blur_event)).
- In the example below, the `onBlur` event handler is used to trigger validation when field loses
  focus
- Only validate if the field has content (avoid validating empty fields on blur unless they
  previously had content)
- Implement the same accessibility patterns as submit validation (`aria-describedby`, role="alert")

  of={ErrorValidation.ValidateErrorOnBlur}
  source={{ code: ValidationOnBlurSrc, language: "tsx" }}
  sourceState="hide"
